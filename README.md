**Utsuwa is an open-source AI companion with 3D VRM avatars.** A platform where you can have a virtual companion that learns and grows with you, bundled with optional mechanics inspired by Japanese [dating sim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dating_sim) games. Utsuwa is privacy-focused — your data is stored locally and never leaves your device.

"Utsuwa" means "vessel" in Japanese - a container for AI to inhabit visually.

## Features

- **VRM Model Viewer**: Load and display VRM 3D avatar models with orbit controls
- **Model-Centric UI**: Full-screen 3D model with unobtrusive overlay controls
- **3D Speech Bubbles**: Chat responses appear as bubbles that track the model's head in 3D space
- **Chat Interface**: Bottom-centered input bar with streaming responses
- **Voice Input**: Speech-to-text via Groq (Whisper) or Web Speech API with real-time audio visualization
- **LLM Integration**: Support for 7 LLM providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, DeepSeek, Ollama, and LM Studio
- **Local Model Discovery**: Ollama and LM Studio discover installed local models directly from your device
- **Text-to-Speech**: Support for ElevenLabs and OpenAI TTS
- **Lip-sync**: Audio-driven mouth animation synced to TTS playback
- **Animations**: VRMA-based idle and talking animations with automatic blinking
- **Character Customization**: Customize your companion's name, personality, and system prompt
- **Companion System**: Multi-axis relationship tracking with mood, events, and semantic memory
- **Semantic Memory**: Local AI-powered memory search using Transformers.js - finds memories by meaning, not just keywords
- **Memory Graph**: Interactive visualization showing how memories connect semantically
- **Data Export/Import**: Download your data as a save file, restore anytime
- **Theming**: Light and dark mode support with system preference detection
- **Desktop App** *(beta, macOS only)*: Native desktop app with transparent overlay mode — your companion floats on your desktop

### Local-First Storage

All your data is stored locally on your device using IndexedDB:
- No database setup required
- Works offline after initial load
- Export/import save files to back up or transfer your data
- Settings > Data to manage your save files

### Companion System

Build a meaningful relationship with your AI companion through a dating sim-inspired progression system:

- **Multi-axis Relationships**: Track affection, trust, intimacy, comfort, and respect separately
- **8 Relationship Stages**: Progress from Stranger → Acquaintance → Friend → Close Friend → Romantic Interest → Dating → Committed → Soulmate
- **Dynamic Mood**: Real-time emotions with causality tracking (she remembers *why* she feels a certain way)
- **Visual Novel Events**: Milestone moments, romantic scenes, and choices that matter - with custom dialogue and branching responses
- **Semantic Memory**: Facts are indexed with vector embeddings for meaning-based retrieval - "outdoor activities" finds memories about hiking. Runs locally using Transformers.js, no API calls
- **Natural Progression**: Hybrid system combining app heuristics + LLM suggestions for believable relationship growth
- **Time-Aware**: Your companion notices when you've been away and reacts accordingly

See the [Companion System Architecture](https://utsuwa.ai/docs/technology/companion-system) for full details.

### Desktop Application (Beta)

A native desktop app built with Tauri that includes all web features plus:

- **Overlay Mode**: Your companion floats on your desktop with a transparent background
- **Always-on-Top**: The overlay stays visible over all other windows
- **Draggable Positioning**: Click and drag the character to reposition anywhere on screen
- **Floating Chat**: Expandable chat input that appears when you click the chat icon
- **Window Switching**: Seamlessly switch between the full app and overlay mode
- **Global Hotkeys**: Push-to-talk, toggle overlay, and focus chat with keyboard shortcuts

The desktop app uses the same codebase as the web version — your save files are compatible between both.

## Supported Providers

### LLM Providers (7)

| Category | Providers |
|----------|-----------|
| **Cloud** | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, xAI (Grok) |
| **Local** | Ollama, LM Studio |

### TTS Providers (2)

| Category | Providers |
|----------|-----------|
| **Cloud** | ElevenLabs, OpenAI TTS |

### STT Providers (2)

| Category | Providers |
|----------|-----------|
| **Cloud** | Groq (Whisper) |
| **Browser** | Web Speech API (no API key required) |

Voice input is accessed via the microphone button in the chat bar. Groq STT uses Whisper for accurate transcription on any platform (including desktop). Web Speech API works without an API key in Chrome, Edge, and Safari. If a Groq API key is configured, it takes priority automatically.

## Getting Started

> [!NOTE]
> Utsuwa is in its very early development stages. If you're using the app, **save your data often**. Early versions may not have backwards-compatible save states and could require manual reformatting.

### Try it Online

Use Utsuwa directly at **[utsuwa.ai](https://utsuwa.ai)** — no installation required. Or download the macOS desktop app from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/The-Lab-by-Ordinary-Company/utsuwa/releases).

### Self-Hosting

If you prefer to run Utsuwa locally or host your own instance:

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- pnpm (recommended) or npm
- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) — for the web version

#### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/The-Lab-by-Ordinary-Company/utsuwa.git
cd utsuwa

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

#### Running the Desktop App (Beta)

To run the desktop app from source, you'll need the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) in addition to the web prerequisites:

```bash
# Install Rust (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Run the desktop app
pnpm tauri dev
```

#### Configuration

1. Click the **Settings** (gear icon) in the sidebar
2. Navigate to **Settings > Character** to configure your chat provider:
   - Enable Chat (LLM)
   - Select a cloud provider and enter your API key
   - Or select a local server like Ollama or LM Studio and choose an installed model from the discovered model dropdown
3. Configure text-to-speech in the same settings area (optional):
   - Select a TTS provider
   - Enter your API key
   - Configure voice settings

All API keys are stored locally on your device and are never sent to any server except the respective API providers.

#### Loading a VRM Model

1. Go to **Settings > Avatar**
2. Click **"Load VRM"** to select a local `.vrm` file
3. Or enter a URL to load a VRM model from the web

#### Data Management

Your companion data is stored locally on your device. To back up or transfer your data:

1. Go to **Settings > Data**
2. Click **Export Save** to download a JSON file with all your data
3. To restore, click **Import Save** and select your save file
4. Choose **Replace** (wipe and restore) or **Merge** (add to existing)
